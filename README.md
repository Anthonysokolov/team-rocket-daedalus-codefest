## What it does
Gym Go is an app designed to motivate people in NYC to go to the gym. Whenever someone goes to the gym, they can sign in via the app, and using geolocation Gym Go will verify that they are actually at the gym, and track how long they stay there for. Going to the gym earns users points, which they can exchange for rewards. Users can also connect with their friends, which adds another motivational aspect.

## How did we build it
The backend of the app was built in Python using Flask. The frontend was built in JavaScript using React Native. The database was built using postgresql.
